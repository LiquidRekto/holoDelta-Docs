# Parameter `imported_deck`

### Usage

```
?imported_deck=<deck_to_add>
```

`<deck_to_add>` is the HoloDelta deck json object that has been converted into base64 format.

::: info
If you haven't yet known what a HoloDelta deck json object looks like, check [this page](/en-US/manual/deck-data/holodelta-json).
:::

When used, if the deck data is valid, a popup should appear to confirm that the player
wants to see the deck in the deck creation screen.
