# Setting up game project

To set up with this part, be sure you've got [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.3-stable/) installed (particularly ver 4.3).

Once setup, launch the editor and proceed to import the project by the following steps:

1. Click ***Import*** or ***Import Existing Project*** if you currently don't have any projects.

The next time you open Godot, you will see the project being on the list. You can open the project from this list.
