# Introduction

Welcome to HoloDelta project!

This section will help setting things up for development of HoloDelta Project, including both setting the server up as well as the game one.

Before we begin, let's do a few baby steps. First make sure [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is installed in your machine. Then proceed to clone the project via this url

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GabeJWJ/holoDelta
```

::: danger IMPORTANT
**For those who want to contribute to the source repository:** Unless you have a direct access to the repository, you won't able to push your changes directly to the source repository. Instead, fork the source repository then clone it instead. It should be this url if you left everything unchanged on fork creation:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/holoDelta
```

Then, if you want to propose your changes to the source repository, make a pull request from your fork.

Once cloned succesfully, let's proceed to next step!
