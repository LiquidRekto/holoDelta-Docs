# What is HoloDelta?

To put simply, an unofficial Hololive OCG simulator (created by [GabeJWJ](https://github.com/GabeJWJ/)).
Supports all current Hololive OCG cards, including the EN version.

For those who are trying the game for the first time, testing out some decks with your friends and far-away friends,
or still thinking whether to buy physical Hololive OCG cards or not, this application is **FOR YOU**.
